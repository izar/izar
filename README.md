**Security Architect | Threat Modeler | Thinkerer**

I work at the intersection of **engineering, security, and pragmatism** ‚Äî helping teams design, build, and maintain systems that can stand up to the real world.  
My specialty is **Continuous Threat Modeling (CTM)** ‚Äî weaving threat modeling into everyday development rather than making it a quarterly ritual.
